# UCSFilesManager
UCS Files Manager is a software tool designed for sound designers and sound design studios to organize their sound libraries following the Universal Category System (UCS) standard. This tool was conceived by myself to streamline the process of sorting and renaming sound files based on predefined categories and keywords.
